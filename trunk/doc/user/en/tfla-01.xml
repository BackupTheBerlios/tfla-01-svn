      <title>What is a logic analyzer?</title>

      <para>
        A logic analyzer is a device which can monitor the high and low states of several
        input lines of a digital logic. It is useful for debugging digital circuits such
        as bus transfers, etc. You can imagine a logic analyzer to be something like
        a digital oscilloscope.
      </para>

      <para>
        Normally, a logic analyzer is a external device with a own controller that has a own
        display or is connected to a PC via USB or serial line. The PC or the display then
        shows the data, e. g. some waveforms.
      </para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="whatsspecial">
      <title>What's special about TFLA-01?</title>

      <para>
        This logic analyzer is designed to be cheap, somehing like a logic analyzer for poor
        men, which means not for industrial use but for hobbyists. It simply consits of a
        schematic which is attached to the PCs parallel port. Therefore, 8 Bit (i. e.
        8 data lines) can be monitored simultaneously.
      </para>

      <para>There's no real external device which
        collects the data: The schematic just protects the parallel port and converts RS232
        level (+/- 12 V) to 5 V TTL level on two pins configurable with jumpers.
        The schematic is described later in this manual. The measuring is done by the PC software
        using the parallel port.
      </para>

      <para>
        This means that the speed depends on your PCs parallel port and on the operating system.
        The data ist just collected by a user process to be portable against different operating
        system. However, with my Athlon XP 2200 and a extra PCI parallel card I get on Linux
        data rates about 1 MHz which is quite well for IÂ²C, RS-232, SPI and some other stuff.

        TFLA-01 is designed to be portable against various operating systems. It is written
        in C++, uses <ulink url="http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt/">Qt</ulink> as
        cross-plattform API mostly for the graphical user interface and
        <ulink url="http://cyberelk.net/tim/libieee1284/">libieee1284</ulink> to access
        the parallel port. This means that it is possible to run TFLA-01 on following

        On hardware side, you need a parallel port. Use the port of your mainboard or a
        additional PCI card. Forget about USB adapters, they are normally designed for
        printers and for nothing else and if it would work, the speed would be insuitable for
        a logic analyzer. (Of course, USB is faster than a parallel port, but that does nothing
        say about the speed of such adapters.) Therefore, a normal Mac would be insuitable
        for such a task -- porting TFLA-01 to MacOS should be not the problem here.

            For displaying the help from TFLA-01, you must have installed
            <application>Qt Assistant</application> and the binary <application>assistant</application>
            must be in <envar>PATH</envar> environment. For example on SUSE, just install the

          <title>Unix via source code</title>

          <para>
            The normal way to install TFLA-01 on Unix is to compile the source code since
            it is impossible for me to provide binaries for all various plattforms. If you've built
            a binary (preferrable a package) for your favourite Unix flavour and you plan to maintain
            it for future TFLA-01 releases, just drop me a note and I'll put a link on the TFLA-01
            homepage or upload the binary. The users will thank you!
          </para>

          <para>
            However, compiling TFLA-01 is not difficult since the dependencies are small.
            Building on Microsoft Windows is different, so this chapter only describes the
            build procedure on Unix. At first, make sure that you have following software
            installed and that the preconditions are met:

                on command line. Also, you have to set <envar>QTDIR</envar> and
                <envar>QMAKESPEC</envar> environment properly, see the
                <ulink url="http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt/">Qt</ulink> documentation for
                more information. On my Linux box <envar>QTDIR</envar> is set to

          <para>
            Just build the software now with

<screen>$ qmake PREFIX=/usr tfla-01.pro
$ make
$ lrelease tfla-01.pro
</screen>

            The first command creates the <filename>Makefile</filename> from the
            <application>qmake</application> project file using the specified <literal>PREFIX</literal>.
            This specifies the installation location (and nothing more, i. e. the pathname is
            not compiled in the binary). If you don't specify <literal>PREFIX</literal>,
            <filename>/usr/local/</filename> is used as a default value. The second command
            builds the software and the third command compiles the translation files.</para>

          <para>
            To install the software, just run

<screen>$ qmake PREFIX=/usr tfla-01.pro
$ su
# make install
</screen>

            You have to repeat the <application>qmake</application> step because the binary
            doesn't get installed if it is not present while running <application>qmake</application>.
            Don't ask me if this is a bug or a feature, it just is so and it's no real problem
            if you know it. Then get root privilegues and install the software. Yes, that's all.

          <title>Windows</title>

          <para>
            The Windows port is not maintained any more, so no new binaries are
            available. If you would like to maintain it, please drop me a
            message. Probably it's easier to port it to Qt 4 if you don't have a Qt 3 version
            for Windows (only Qt 4 was released under the conditions of GPL).

      <sect3>
        <title>Permissions</title>

        <para>
          Because you want to run the application as normal user and not only as administrator,
          you have to deal with permissions of the operating system. This depends really on the
          system (i. e. there are differences between Unix flavours and even Windows versions)
          and does not depend whether you compile the program by hand or use a binary
          to install, so I made an extra section.
        </para>

        <sect4>
          <title>Linux</title>

          <para>
            On recent Linux versions (Kernel 2.4 and higher), the applications uses internally
            the <application>ppdev</application> kernel module. It should be loaded automatically.
            If not, use
          </para>

          <screen># modprobe ppdev </screen>

          <para>
            to load the module once. On SUSE, you can add the module to
            <literal>MODULES_LOADED_ON_BOOT</literal> variable in
            <filename>/etc/sysconfig/kernel</filename>.
          </para>

          <para>
            The other thing you have to make sure is that the user which runs the TFLA-01
            program has read and write permissions to the <filename>/dev/paraportX</filename>
            device file where <literal>X</literal> means the number of the parallel port you
            want to access.
          </para>

          <para>
            The classical approach is to create a group <emphasis>parport</emphasis>, set
            the owning group of the parallel port device to <emphasis>parport</emphasis>, change
            the parallel port to <literal>crw-rw----</literal> and add the users to the group
            as necessary. Read the manual of your Linux distribution for details. Since the
            device files are normally created by <application>udev</application> in a modern
            distribution, you have to add a file
            <filename>/etc/udev/rules.d/90-parport.rules</filename> that
            contains
          </para>

<programlisting>
KERNEL="parport[0-9]", MODE="664", GROUP="parport"
</programlisting>

          <para>
            It's also possible to add this to an existing rules files, but
            that's problematic for updates. Creating a new file is the cleaner
            approach. The number determines the order in which the files are
            used -- for the parallel port, that doesn't matter.  Add all users
            that should have permission to use the parallel port to that group.
            You have to log out and log in again to apply this.

          <para>
            This is a single user operating system where the current user has all permissions
            so nothing needs do be done. However, we don't recommend it for using with
            the TFLA-01, it's unstable, insecure, we didn't test it and we will not test it.
            In short: it's unsupported but it may work, though.

        displays the number of collected samples in the status line. This may give you a

      <title>Triggering</title>

      <para>
        Triggering is useful if you want to monitor a line for a longer period of time and
        you mostly wait for an event to occure. For example you are alone and you have to start
        the logic analyzer to monitor data and you also have to do some manual steps to start
        the action on the data lines to occure.
      </para>

      <para>
        For each line you can configure if the line should be low or high to trigger of if
        the line should be ignored. If all lines are set to <emphasis>ignore</emphasis>,
        triggering is disabled. The display of the three states may depend of the GUI style
        of <ulink url="http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt">Qt</ulink>, the screenshot
        shows the Windows, ThinKeramik and Motif style. The first line is set to trigger
        on low level, the second on high level and all other lines are ignored.

      <note>
        <para>
          Triggering may not work if the period where the value which should be triggered
          for is two low. Since the function which waits for the triggered data is a part of the
          <ulink url="http://cyberelk.net/tim/libieee1284/">libieee1284</ulink> parallel port
          library, we have no influence on this.
        </para>
        <para>
          Also, triggering may be implemented differently on the operating system. For
          example on Linux it's part of the kernel module which means that there's no
          CPU usage until the triggered value is detected.
